This is the question on top of everyone’s minds, the question keeping us up at night. (Well, in addition to these other questions: "Are we going to die?", “Is this it, is this the end?”, “How did this happen?”, and “Why, WHY?!”)

There are a number of resources created by thoughtful people that offer some clues for how to start.

* There is [Peter Levine’s flowchart](http://peterlevine.ws/?p=17674) for how we might proceed, with a focus on individual inner assessment of priorities to help guide each of our paths forward

* There are [step-by-step guides](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/8-steps-to-organize-against-trump-starting-now_us_5824b303e4b01e4dcf34ba56) on how to get started with community organizing, which is at the core of political and social change

* There are [apps](http://mashable.com/2016/11/29/trump-organizing-apps-sites/) that facilitate the hard work of community organizing

* There are [ways to frame this enormous problem](https://newsone.com/3590655/post-election-anxiety-psychologist-explains-how-to-deal-with-the-dread-of-a-trump-administration/) such that we draw strength from the victories of our past struggles and remind ourselves that it is possible to enact paradigm-shifting change by working together

At the core of all of these suggestions for moving forward, there is the notion of working together. This conjures images of friends and neighbors gathering in meeting rooms, frantically planning some sort of action together.

And that’s just the thing. It is natural to begin to do something so hard and daunting by starting within our known circles. We might talk with trusted members of our family, or perhaps progressive-minded coworkers who end up inviting us to go to a demonstration or another activity to push for change. We may come home at the end of the day, from work or school or elsewhere, and confide in our loved ones about the events of the day and insights that we had about what might be possible to do to influence our futures.

I think these tactics are brilliant. They are rooted in our natural desire to have these difficult conversations in groups that we can trust. This is really important during an era of feeling our bodies and our rights to be under assault.

Another tactic that sometimes gets overlooked during these discussions on the topic of "What can we do?" is **coalition-building**. I suspect that this is because most of us are not academically or otherwise trained in the mechanisms of community organizing. As a person with an abiding interest in matters of social progressivism, I myself am having to work to uncover the information that I’m looking for, and to demystify even to myself these terms that feel esoteric and overwhelming.

I would like to share with you what I have learned.

## A [coalition](http://www.worc.org/media/Work_in_Coalitions.pdf) is an alliance for joint action.
<br>
That is to say, a coalition is a group of people that is trying to achieve their goals.

The difference between a coalition and any other group of people is: the group that comprises a coalition is *in turn formed of other groups* which each have distinct identities and goals. Only **some** of the goals of these groups may overlap. There be even be times when **none** of the explicit goals of these groups are the same. One group might have Goal 1, and the other group might have Goal 2. But the work of these two groups in the one coalition might be to work to achieve *both* Goals, 1 and 2. If the goals themselves are not in opposition to either group’s values, this is a great way to double each group’s power with respect to each of their goals.

Coalitions can be formally named and incorporated or exist as informal networks.

For example, the San Diego Hunger Coalition is [an alliance between dozens of groups](http://www.sandiegohungercoalition.org/strategic-partners/) with varying levels of affiliation around the specific issue of hunger.

Coalitions may be long-lived or formed in the short-term to achieve specific goals.

For example, diverse groups on both sides of the political spectrum band together before elections, and form temporary coalitions to get out the vote and work to get their preferred candidate elected.

## Any effort to create or join existing coalitions must start with a focus on common values.
<br>
You may not think you have much in common with groups fighting for a particular cause, but it is useful to not dismiss them outright. It is usually worthwhile to analyze the activities of local, national, and international groups to find common values.

For example, is there a local religious group that focuses on poverty as an issue? What might be one way to relate this group’s values to your own interest in, for example, immigration justice? If you show up to help them advance their cause, might you be able to build a relationship over time such that you might expect their support in work that you are doing with your group?

Is it worth it to elect a particular progressive to a contested Congressional seat, if that particular progressive does not have the same full roster of issues on their agenda as that of your group? It is possible for such action to pay off in the longer run if there is trust between their group and your group on the basis of some of your shared values.

In my own life, I have erred on the side of caution when asked to ally with a group or a cause whose full agenda does not match mine. Some of this caution is owed to my natural sense of self-preservation -- sometimes, such alliances can be damaging to our own chances of survival and prosperity. There are no guarantees. But in seeking to be a person who pushes for change in this caustic, frightening era, I am forced to reckon with the knowledge that there is great power in numbers.

The most possible civic power is enabled by working together in groups, and even beyond, leading our groups into coalitions with other groups. This concept of "coalition" needs to increasingly be part of our vocabulary as we brace for the battles ahead of us in the next four years.

What that means for us is: We will need to show up like we have never showed up before. We will need to observe carefully the asks of the ACLU *and* the Southern Poverty Law Center *and* Black Lives Matter *and* Republicans Against Trump. We will need to balance self-preservation simultaneously with building the most power that we can across diverse groups.

It is the only way we will get through this landscape of horrors come Friday, January 20, 2017.
