If there’s one thing I know, it’s that life can be hard. Sometimes, it takes a lot just to get out of bed and make it through the day. But we have to do what we need to do to survive.

Maybe we grew up with love and great role models. Or maybe we grew up knowing anger and hatred intimately. Most of us learned a combination of things that were good and things that were bad. And either way, we grew, and we learned to survive.

We learned to get the combination of air, water, food, shelter, and companionship that was required to make it through today and on to tomorrow.

### We do what we can. To make it through today, and on to tomorrow.
<br>
I’m talking about all of us, from all walks of life. Maybe we work in a factory, or in a house, or in an office, or outside. We do what we can to make those dollars. We use those dollars to buy a combination of basic necessities that enables us to survive.

I think of this as the Game of Survival. It doesn’t feel like a choice for most of us. It feels like a burden, something we are forced into, something we cannot forsake.

This limits us, chokes us, narrows the realm of possibility to a world in which we are but survivors, making it through another day.

Don’t get me wrong, surviving is obviously necessary. Survival is something that *has to happen*. Without breathing and making it through, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. I wouldn’t be writing this. You wouldn’t be reading this.

### The thing that I think is wrong is for the Survival Game to be the ONLY GAME that we play.
<br>
Because life? Life is BIG. Life is ENORMOUS.

Life is FULL of possibilities. There are many, MANY games we can play.

Most of what we imagine to be the absolute, unequivocal truth? Is imaginary. It is imaginary, because it is shaped by the bounds of our imagination.

Can’t start a business on the side because work is too hard? Because you’ve just had enough for today and all you need is to get home and turn on the TV? Day after day, week after week?

This is a limitation you have placed upon yourself by imagining fully-fleshed, entire scenarios, in which you recklessly quit your job and then flounder in your garage failing to execute on your dreams. YOUR BRAIN comes up with these things and it feels so real and it’s terrifying. So on goes the TV, and it dims down the light of your dreams.

### Your imagination holds you back from playing a different game, the Game of Prosperity.
<br>
Because most of us bend to programming that wills us to Survive, to the exclusion of Prosperity. Using survival as an excuse, as a distraction from prosperity, is the thing that most of us do.

Do you want to live your life eking out a meager existence?

Do you want to do the bare minimum?

Do you want to only what is expected of you?

Do you want to burn away your life in an endless series of moments in which you're either hustling just to get by, or trying to distract yourself from the fact that your whole life, you've been hustling just to get by?

### Or do you want to wake up, and begin prospering?
<br>
Deep inside all of us are shiny, boundless dreams. As kids, we dreamed of prosperity. We dreamed of wild adventures. We dreamed of becoming people whose lives were SO EXCITING. We would grow up to become astronauts, or artists, or scientists, or actors, or doctors, or adventurers.

We would be these dazzling people full time! Saving lives! Performing miracles! Worthy of praise and admiration!

### What would your childhood self think if they were looking at who you’ve become?
<br>
Maybe this child would, in fact, admire you. Maybe this child would respect you, and be so excited to grow up to be you.

*Don’t you want the ghost children of your past to feel like they can’t possibly wait to hurry up and grow up to become you?*

It’s not too late.

### Start playing another game, a game in which your end goal is to prosper.
<br>
Start visualizing, in more and more detail, what prosperity means for you.

Does prosperity mean you sell your house and travel around the world with someone you love? Does prosperity mean you start that side-business you’ve been dreaming about? Does prosperity mean you spend every weekend painting, writing, fashion-designing, dancing, or filmmaking?

Do you want to learn 3D animation so that you can finally make games?

Do you want to take a Spanish class so that you can visit all of Latin America by yourself and be able to get around?

Do you want to meet the leaders in your local politics that you, yes, YOU, can begin to create change within your community?

What DAZZLES you? What are your BIGGEST DREAMS? What is the shiny thing that is buried SO DEEPLY inside of you that it HURTS to close your eyes and look at it, it HURTS to see it because you’re afraid?

In some cases, you will see it, and you will retreat, because you are afraid that you will never have it. You are afraid of the emotions that people feel when they fail to achieve a dream that actually means something to them.

Well guess what. If this is your problem, then I have great news for you. You are ALREADY feeling those emotions. You are ALREADY failing to achieve your dream. This is the reality of your daily life. Every day, you feel that low-level anxiety. Every day, the fabric of your existence has the undercurrent of dissatisfaction, anger, fear, that you are doing the things that are the opposite of your dream. That you are not trying.

The reason that this is great news is that you’re surviving!

### Because, congratulations, you know how to withstand the emotions wrought by failure, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE ALREADY DOING.
<br>
If anything, you’re an expert at surviving failure. This is one weird benefit of this state of "failure-by-default," is that you have your coping mechanisms ready to go.

So, I don’t see the fear of failure as a legitimate reason to stop YOUR OWN SELF from chasing your biggest, most audacious dream. The skills of handling failure are the very same skills that you are currently using to avoid even the possibility of success.

I’m not saying to jump off the cliff of possibilities. Don’t dangerously hazard your life away. Don’t immediately dive into something so physically or mentally strenuous that you hurt yourself.

But push yourself emotionally. Be willing to feel the full spectrum of your human emotions. Be willing to taste the newness of emotional discomfort, when you come home from work and you’re exhausted, but you need to get through that hour you blocked off on your calendar to start working on a small part of your big, shiny, audacious dream.

Be willing to power through the exhaustion and DO SOMETHING. GET STARTED. BE UNCOMFORTABLE.

You will stretch, and you will grow. You will begin to WANT to do more at nights and on weekends. Your eyes will light up when you talk to your family, to your friends, about your project. Some of them won’t get it. Some of them will dissuade you.

But are you really going to let these naysayers stop you from LIVING? If a rando, or even someone you love and respect, tells you that your plan to PROSPER, to LIVE, isn’t a good plan, are you going to then stop TRYING TO PROSPER, TRYING TO LIVE?

Because THAT is what it means to thrive. THAT is what it means to achieve your potential. LIVING is not the business of feeding yourself and hauling yourself back and forth from work until you retire and then die.

Living is not merely reacting to the cards that you've been dealt. Living is ACTING, living is doing an act of LIFE. It is when you venture somewhere, learn something, create something, feel something, do something.

### It is a willful forging of your path. It is doing the things that warrant you using the expression, "I feel alive".
<br>
It is something altogether different from just making it through the day.

You will still have to make it through the day. But if you slowly start to actually work on something that matters to you, there will come a day, very soon, when your daily existence won’t feel like drudgery. You will know that you are taking action that imbues your life with meaning, that grows your existence into actual life.

And you will smile at the memory of the child you were, and you will know that this child CAN’T WAIT to be you.
