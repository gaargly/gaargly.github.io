It would not be this one.

The world in which I’d want to live would be another world.

I close my eyes, and I breathe. I slow to recognize what I see.

I see a world in which nobody is asking me where I’m from based on what I look like. Maybe a world in which my flesh is not even something they can perceive. Or if they have a way to perceive my flesh, then they still don’t feel free to draw conclusions based on their perception. The thing that helps them get an idea of who I am, what I like, what I want, what I do, is me telling them, willingly, voluntarily, freely.

I feel free to tell randos at a bus-stop about my ambitions and my dreams. And there are plenty of people at the bus-stop. Some of them are maybe reading, but lots others are talking, to each other, there is a low and soothing murmur pervading the atmosphere.

And there are plenty of buses. And they are all electric and free. And self-driving. And this is how it’s been, for centuries. It is unquestionable that free, self-driving, electric buses are how we get around. There’s also the subway and trains to take us places. Sometimes there are planes. People give rides freely. People hitchhike freely. Nobody is scared to help anyone. All people approach each other with a sense that they are approaching another part of themselves. The default is compassion and open-mindedness. The default is a mindset of abundance.

There are lively debates between people about the best way to go about things. This is loosely analogous to the real world’s political parties. But is it even?

No, no it’s not. It’s more like a salon, from the olden days, from yesteryear. Nobody feels forced or attacked. There is a general level of interest that pervades all communities, and everyone is allowed and feels encouraged to participate in dialogue about how best to achieve goals. But everybody is aligned on what the goals are.

## The goals in this world are for everybody to survive and to prosper.
<br>
Everybody works on this, in whichever manner suits them best. Children still have existential crises in which they question how they might best contribute to this mission. But everybody agrees that that’s the mission. Everybody sees it as their job, personally, to move this mission forward.

And there is no scarcity, anymore. The problems of distributing resources such that everyone has clean air, drinkable water, edible food, sufficient shelter, and communities in which to feel a sense of belonging, are largely solved. There is abundance. People only do menial tasks when they want to. There are enclaves of engineers, artists, artisans, and other craftspeople. They make tables and plumbing and systems as art. Some others like to consume this hand-made art. But it is easy to get the base requirements of what one needs to survive in a pinch, because that is the work of robots who can make you a little house real quick if you need a place to stay.

Leisure and pleasure are a given. Activities for leisure and pleasure, and the actual lived experiences of leisure and pleasure, are not maligned. They are a natural, normal part of thriving in a society where everybody feels responsible for their own prosperity and for that of others.

People still make mistakes, people still experience words and actions as violence. There are people trained in mediation to facilitate healing between these parties. And the patterns of these upsets look so different than they do in the real world that I can’t even really imagine them. Certainly, these are not conflicts borne out of fear based on the flesh of people, on the shapes of their bodies, of the length of the protein growing out of their pores. These are not conflicts because someone is worried they won’t have enough to eat. These are not conflicts because people are worried about owning land to live on.

The bare necessities are a given, and everybody understands the systems that produce them, and many people find them interesting and study them and act in various ways to improve them.

Children run happy and death is elective or endlessly deferred. There are planets everywhere that are like this, where people live like this. There are virtual realities that one can cross into, to feel what scarcity was like, what horrifying violence was like. These are places for people to go into to experience the full range of their human emotions. For horror enthusiasts, for artists who want to better know the darker things, these virtual realities exist, where they can experience what racism used to be like. Everyone comes out after a time in these game-like landscapes with a better understanding of what violence used to be. What poverty meant, for individuals and for societies. People are able to live the lives of royalty, and of deprivation, and they can choose to leave the game after they’ve had enough.

Outside the games, there are lots of people trained, to help them process what they’ve just played. Nobody is left to fend for themselves unless that is what they choose.

And I am one person peopling this world, interacting with my peers in various ways. My desires are that I engage with people pleasantly and collaboratively. I also want to make art, feel passion, feel pain. I am able to choose these things. I am able to engage in those aspects of the human experience that I find most fulfilling.

There is a sense of limitlessness, a sense of boundless optimism, and anticipation. Because though we, as humanity, have solved many entrenched problems and permanently ensured everybody’s ability to survive for as long as they want, there are other interesting problems left still, to solve. We are sometimes pushed up against the resistance from the systems that we’ve built. What that resistance looks like, what that feeling is to be pushed up against it, is a feeling I cannot describe, because I don’t know how we have accomplished the implementations of these systems or what they even really are. But there is still a sense of problems that remain to be solved, and things that people can do together, if they want, to solve them.

People who are children and people who are teenagers and people who are adults and people who are older do not make assumptions about who will "understand" them and who they’re allowed to be friends with. Everyone is allowed association with anyone. Society doesn’t expect otherwise. You choose the people with whom you will be friends, with consent from them. To do anything else would be absurd and against the norms in this world.

There are new, fun, creative ways of expressing oneself. People fly up into the air for a nanosecond to make a point, emphasize an emotion. Jetpacks maybe, I’m not sure.

It looks metallic but also floral and organic and strange and homey and natural and vivid. It is everything that we want it to be. Everything is.

There are new, fun, creative ways of imagining sciences. It is not uncommon to find an assortment of people in different places, working on equations, writing things down, math intermingled with poetry. We are still trying to figure out things like how to get from one place in the universe to another really, really fast. We are still trying to figure out if we might vanish and reappear elsewhere instantaneously. Some people are still working on alchemy, and science now knows that this can happen, but can it be economical? And what would be the point? Is it just to create something shiny because shiny things are sometimes pretty and creating things is awesome? Since we no longer need the gold to pay for survival, to fend for things?

"Fending for oneself" is a term that has either lost meaning, or means something so different that we cannot imagine it now, from this vantage point, from my brain seeing it as an outsider looking in, as the past trying to feel the future.

And in this future, or perhaps lateral dimension, people experience most of their lived days as deeply satisfying. They are frustrating sometimes, if we want them to be, or sometimes, unexpectedly, even if we didn’t want that feeling. But there is a sense of freedom, to go up against these emotions and against the challenges that trigger them. There is a sense of boundlessness, of true liberation, to band together or go off alone and be who we want to be, do what we want to do.

## Is it possible that our current, real world has many ingredients of what really excite me about this imaginary, perfect other world?
<br>
Maybe! Actually, yes! The core of the work of resistance is to solve the problems of survival and of prosperity. There are so many flavors to this work, so much to learn and so many directions in which to grow. So much of this work is deeply stimulating, and the challenge of it feels exciting and delicious and frustrating and herculean. It is also vivid and deeply fulfilling. It also feels like trying to build a utopia, that believing in the survival of everybody (let alone in their/all of our prosperity) is believing in something wildly imaginative and surreal.

The work of resistance often feels like the exact right thing to do. It leaves my days feeling satisfying. Identifying its elements and processing it through writing and through discussion and through action, provide me with a sense of flow. It is this flow, this magical state of goodness and rightness and trueness, that I want for everybody in the whole entire world from the beginning of time to its end. It is this deliciousness that I want all possible individual and joint and group consciousnesses to taste and to behold and to revel in.

Thinking that we cannot have this is a failure of imagination. We create the things that we wish to see in the world. Sometimes, yes, we create other things that just sort of happened by accident, or were some kind of by-product, or is largely not good. But the big things, the waves of resistance and of collective action that won greater and greater freedoms for different people, those things were first seeds in somebody’s minds. They literally summoned like a ghost of what they wanted to have happen, and then they talked to other people who were having similar thoughts, millions (billions?) of people in human history have worked together to try and get it done.

So, instead of acquiescing to failures of imagination that taunt me, that whisper into my thought stream at night that none of this can ever happen, I will try, for as long as I can, to imagine ways in which we can have this other world of which I dream. Solving the problems of human survival and prosperity will be justice. Solving these problems of human survival and prosperity will be pleasure. Solving these problems is good and right and true.
