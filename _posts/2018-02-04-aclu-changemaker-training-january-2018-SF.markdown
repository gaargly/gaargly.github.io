And...

## it was a mixed bag.

* Before the event, I wasn't sure what the training would entail. Based on some of the ACLU's messaging, a friend and I figured they'd focus on local advocacy training around three issues: voting rights, criminal justice, and reproductive rights.
* I ended up attending with three other friends, one of whom flew in from San Diego to attend this training together in San Francisco.
* The organizers of the event seemed overwhelmed by the turnout of over a hundred people. There were a number of logistical glitches like AV malfunctions and coffee that was unexpectedly delayed for several hours.
* I learned about the importance of the District Attorney (DA) and the outsized power that they wield in their cities.


## The ACLU really wanted us to meet our DA.

* The ACLU has invested in their "Meet your DA" campaign, which they have up at [meetyourda.org](https://meetyourda.org/).
* "If someone is accused of committing a crime, it is not the police but the DA who has the sole power to decide if criminal charges are filed and the severity of those charges. They alone decide who is deserving of a jail or prison sentence and who will instead be routed into a diversion program to help rebuild their life, or have charges dismissed. "
* The trainers urged us many times to commit to meet our DAs in advance of the many DA elections this year.


## What I liked:

* Going with other friends and appreciating together the good and the bad about any event is usually pretty fun, and we did this during and after this training.
* I didn't know much about District Attorneys before and this training provided the impetus for me to learn more.


## What I was disappointed by:

* Much of the training occurred in lengthy classroom-style slideshow presentations. I felt talked at rather than talked with.
* I learned from my community organizer friend that the ACLU apparently does not invest in community organizers who are leaders in the communities impacted by the very things they were talking about. The ACLU instead invests in lawyers and administrators.
* Building strong relationships with members of their communities are a foundational element of the community organizing process, and the ACLU seems to lack that. It felt weird to go to a place to hear about heartbreaking things like racist policing, criminalization of communities of color, and mass incarceration -- primarily through slideware, and to then leave without having made new, compelling relationships with other people who are invested in action.
* This event was in San Francisco! A city famous for its progressive politics! _And_ the ACLU is a very prestigious, well-resourced, and well-known organization. It felt dissonant to be at a well-attended training where the turnout was a surprise to the organizers and most of what happened was being talked at for several hours. We can do better in San Francisco and as members of the ACLU!


## Things to do next:

* Understand who are the progressive candidates for DA elections this year whose elections are within the scope of our influence.
* Understand how the ACLU might do better in how they resource and run their Changemaker trainings.
