On Saturday, January 20 2018, I marched with the [Women's March in San Francisco](https://www.facebook.com/events/1942264432450715/).

## I ended up going with 9 other friends and this is how we did it:

* We met at a coffee shop near the march beforehand to gather and make signs, which was really fun.
* We walked over and attended the rally and met up with other friends there.
* We marched from Civic Center to the Embarcadero.


## What I liked:

* [Brittany Packnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Packnett) spoke at the rally and [she was amazing](https://twitter.com/maybeitsmagic/status/954850768615387136).
* This year's march had solid [Unity Principles](http://womensmarchca.com/unity/).
* It was really fun to march with friends and like [50,000 to 60,000 other people](http://abc7news.com/politics/womens-march-participants-flood-san-francisco/2972358/)!


## What I was disappointed by:

* Last year, [about 100,000 people turned out for the inaugural Women's March](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/01/21/huge-crowd-san-francisco-rally-womens-march/), so this year's turnout was half as big.
* Compared to last year, I found less media coverage about expected turnout before the SF March, and actual turnout after the SF March. In general, I suspect a less concerted effort to cover the march in San Francisco.
* I felt an absence of specific resources to tackle the organizers' five levels of actions listed below:

    * Voter Registration
    * Voter Turnout
    * Organize Localy [sic]
    * Increasing women in office (especially women of color)
    * Electing progressive women and allies

## Things to do next:

* Figure out who was organizing.
* Understand the barriers to Voter Registration in San Francisco.
  * In SF, who needs to be registered to vote in which communities and which groups are working on it?
  * When are the next important local, state and national elections, and what are the deadlines for voter registration for each one?
* How can I support next year's Women's March in SF?
  * What happened with media outreach before and after the march this year, and how can we boost media coverage and therefore excitement and therefore turnout before the march in SF next year?
