Why should I care about oppression?

What is racism?

What is sexism?

What is feminism?

What is *intersectional* feminism?

What is homophobia?

What is transphobia?

What is colonialism?

What is oppression?

What are all of these things?

What do all these things have in common?

What’s my part in all this?

### And why should I care?
<br>

## We should care because knowing what these things mean will help us to survive and prosper in this world.
<br>
I want to explain where I’m coming from when I make this claim.

Let’s get back to these questions about "-isms" and “-phobias”.

For some, these are haunting questions. For others, they may be passing confusions that don’t occupy much time or energy on a daily basis.

But these are not terms that lend themselves particularly well to understanding.

For one, they are emotionally loaded. Conversations in which any of these phrases that end with "-ism" or “phobia” tend to feel like accusations. There is a palpable tension, a feeling that the person who is using this word is, in fact, using it as a weapon to hurt us. Maybe they don’t like us for some reason and they are using these words to demean us, to damage our reputation, to pick a fight.

So already, we’re on the defensive when it comes to the -isms and the -phobias.

And they are also hard words, complex words, words that almost feel designed by conspirators to elude understanding.

In my experience, people sometimes do try to learn what these terms mean. Maybe you have a story about asking someone to define what they mean when they call something "racist". Maybe that conversation went well. Or maybe it dangerously veered off course, threatening the very foundation of your connection with this person.

So why bother thinking about these Pandora’s boxes?

Before we move on, I’m going to ask you to suspend your disbelief. Just as an exercise, if nothing else. Pretend that everything I’m saying is true. Pretend that these are facts that are being presented to you in a science class, in a documentary that you’re watching.

It will be like a game that we play for a short period of time and then you can be done if you want to.

## In this post, I’m going to talk about the last question: **Why should I care?**
<br>
Caring about something simply means that you are choosing to invest some amount of energy into it. The form of investment can range from spending just a few moments thinking about the thing you care about, to more effort in the form of talking about it with your friends and loved ones, all the way to physically getting up and going somewhere to do something that advances the thing that you care about.

I don’t judge you for caring about the things that you care about. We were all taught to care about basics such as air and food and water and shelter, from a young age. We also learned about family structures and companionship from our experiences as children, and probably more as we grew and entered different kinds of adult relationships. We learned about some higher-level needs such as the concept of "having a meaningful life" as we perhaps associated with philosophy-minded friends, teachers, and colleagues.

I really think that everything that we care about comes down to its impact on our needs.

We assume a stance on, for example, immigration, because we want to ensure that we have our basic needs met. Maybe we are afraid that if we don’t make it across a border today, that we will die. On the other side of that same border, maybe we are afraid that if someone *does* make it across that line today, that *we* will die.

Or maybe it’s not so dire, maybe it’s not about life or death. But maybe it’s about food, or land, or shelter. We seek to go where we can have our needs met. No one wants to sit around waiting to starve, waiting to be without a home. When confronted with these possibilities, most of us choose to take some kind of action, and seek a better way, for ourselves, for our families, for our loved ones.

Sometimes, we are in a different position -- the position of having our needs met, but we are afraid that what we have will be taken from us. Snatched away. We might be fine now, but perhaps we perceive a threat to how things could be a year from now or some decades from now. What if the things that we built are taken away from our children after we’re gone? How will they survive?

All of us have these what-ifs, which themselves provide an explanation for why we do the things that we do. We care about things that relate to our basic or higher-level needs. We express that caring by saying something, doing something.

We develop stances on particular issues as a result of what we care about, which in turn is a result of the needs we are trying to meet.

Now think about everyone in the entire world.

Every single person is doing this.

Every single person is trying to do this.

We breathe and we live to see another day because of the ways in which we work to maintain our ability to live, the actions that we take to survive and to thrive.

## Every single person in the entire world is trying to do *the exact same thing*, which is, to be able to breathe and eat and be with our loved ones.
<br>
I think this common interest can give us strength. This is *all* of our MO. This is what *all* of us do. We first prioritize survival. And then, sometimes, we turn our minds to higher questions of how we might prosper.

Our lives are limited and we have finite energy and everything that we do roughly falls into these two categories of surviving or thriving.

Trying survive and trying to thrive are the *only* things to do. Survival means the same things for all of us -- breathing, eating, living to see another day. Thriving might assume different forms for each of us individually. But the verbs are the same for us all, and have been the same since the beginning of human history.

So, what is the reason we should care about those phrases I mentioned at the very beginning of this post, all the ones that end in "-isms" and “-phobias”?

## We should care because these phrases help us understand better how to survive and how to thrive.
<br>
These phrases help us name the feelings we get when our lives are at stake, when we are under serious threat, when our very bodies might perish if we fail to understand what is happening around us. It is critical to have a deep knowledge of our environment, if we are to, for example, not get hit by a bus when crossing a road, or not get shot by somebody who is scared of us. These phrases that end in "-isms" and “-phobias” are simply names for concepts about our environment.

Sometimes, we understand the concepts quite intuitively. We may not call them these same names. But *getting* these concepts, on either a named or an unnamed level, can be the difference between life or untimely death. *Understanding* these concepts can be the difference between reaching our potential as human beings, and dying without achieving our dreams.

Say you learn what an "-ism" is, but it doesn’t seem applicable to your own life. In this case, imagine that someone you know is asking you to consider how this concept could apply to their life. Imagine that a friend with a different background or different characteristics or different preferences from yours, who nonetheless is trying to achieve the same exact thing as you are in life (i.e. survive and/or thrive), is affected by something in their environment, and they are using a word that ends in “-ism” or “-phobia” to describe their experience. They are trying to describe to you their understanding of their environment. They are telling you about something that matters very much to them, because it gets down to the core of what their life is about -- and it is the same core as what your life is about. They want to use their understanding to process what is happening to them. They are trying to share that understanding with you.

Isn’t it inherently interesting to explore these matters of life and death with people?

## Isn’t it inherently interesting to hear people’s ideas about how their environment is impacting their chances of survival and prosperity during their finite time on earth? (The stakes are so high! Of course it’s interesting!)
<br>
Don’t you think that by having this discussion, you might learn something that helps you explore *your* own environment, something that helps *you* improve your own chances of survival and prosperity during *your* finite time on earth?

If you are not the kind of person who holds doors open for people who are trying to carry a heavy box into the building, know that there is nothing stopping you from being that kind of person. All you have to do is hold open that door next time. And someone will hold open a door for you when you’re the one carrying a heavy box. It really can be that easy to practice compassion.

We are all carrying heavy things, and we are all trying to go places. It helps to know what someone is carrying. It helps to know where they are trying to go.

For the exact reason that it helps *you* when someone listens to *your* story about what happened to you today and the impact that it had on you. It helps when someone listens to your understanding of your environment and how it has influenced your chances of survival and prosperity.

Being surrounded by successful people is how *we* get successful. Do children who have parents to help them with homework do better in school? Do employees who have supervisors to mentor them do better in their careers? Do peers who hear about the life experiences of others learn new ways to enrich their own lives?

Of course!

We have skin in this game because success begets success. It is an act of compassion to raise another person, to lift them towards success. An act of compassion towards the other person, because you have extended something in yourself to give them this gift of listening and empathy.

## But also an act of compassion towards yourself, because you have added to the success of someone around you, which means that you have increased the prosperity of your own world, which in turn has increased your own chances of prospering.
<br>
So that is why you should care about these hard words that describe challenging concepts. Because it is good when someone else chooses to care about something that affects your own prosperity. And because by caring about them, you are actively adding to the prosperity of yourself and of others.
