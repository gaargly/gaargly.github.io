I work in tech because I fell into it and now, here I am, and it's pretty fun, and seems like we occasionally create useful things.

A while ago, while browsing online, I came across a job description that called for "experience in oppression analysis", and I was like, I wonder what that is.

The phrase "oppression analysis" rang a bell for me, pretty faintly. In college, I learned from my friends about what "feminism" was, and how there were many feminisms with different stakeholders and lenses and goals. Feminism feels like a loose, nebulous concept, and the very process of trying to define it and talking about its various components feels like exercises in analyzing oppression.

I wondered, then, upon coming across this job requirement, what it means to analyze oppression in a systematic way -- what would the curriculum be if one were to take an "Analysis of Oppression" course at like a liberal arts institution.

I began googling and found some resources, one of which is this paper, []"A Structural Analysis of Oppression", authored by Sandra Hinson and Alexa Bradley.] (http://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/structural_analysis_oppression.pdf)

This paper calls for "ways of talking about the intersections of race and class that lift up our similarities while honoring our differences", particularly in the context of grassroots movements.

The authors reference Iris Marion Young's writings as inspiration for a framework that focuses on people's lived experiences, and their resulting experimental framework gives names to how people experience oppressive conditions.

I'm always inspired by the questioning of the defaults in the "corporate-dominated, market-driven" society in which we live. When I witness oppressive conditions in my life or the lives of those around me, I want to see them as a way of seeing the truth. A lot of how we auto-pilot through our lives -- wake up, commute to work, create value at work, commute back to our homes, sleep early so as to have energy to do the same thing all over again the next day -- leaves little room for zooming out to create narratives about how our lives fit together in civil society. So, reading this paper means a lot to me because the authors seek to uncover these many truths, on shedding light on what we experience as we move around in our worlds and do things.

They define oppression as a type of structure in which people live, in which other groups have the power to determine people's actions. People experience oppression as a result of being grouped together by shared characteristics such as race, class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, nationality, age, ability, and others.

Oppression is not necessarily intentional, and memberships in these groups is not necessarily voluntary or acknowledged.

tl;dr, one way of looking at oppression categories oppression into five forms, the definitions of which I summarize at a very high level below:

### Exploitation

Exploitation is when the haves benefit from controlling the have-nots. Different class, race, and gender groups experience exploitation in different ways.

### Marginalization

Marginalization is exclusion via stigmatization or other means, particularly exclusion out of labor markets i.e. exclusion out of being named as productive members of society.

### Powerlessness

Powerlessness is when people are routinely shut out of decisions that affect the basic conditions of their lives.

### Cultural Dominance

Cultural Dominance is the way that one group's experiences, cultural expressions, and history are defined as superior to all other groups' experiences and histories -- either explicitly, or implicitly when the superiority is treated as universal, optimal, or normal.

### Violence

Violence is when people live in fear of attacks that are meant to humiliate and/or destroy them because of their membership in certain social groups. This include feeling under threat as a result of ongoing harassment, as well as outright violent acts.


The five forms of oppression overlap with each other and cannot be organized into a neat hierarchy. "Most people in society experience one or more of these forms of oppression at some point in their lives."

Since the experience of one or more forms of oppression appears to be nearly universal, it is worthwhile to examine these constructs when we try to understand what different people are going through, as part of our struggle to build a better world through collective action for social change.
